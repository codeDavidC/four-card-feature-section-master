## My process and what I learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design. I also drew the containers for each element on the page to provide a visualization of how everything is structured before I code.

I learned how to use CSS Grid and positioning imges to the right in a container using CSS Flexbox, and also how to use box-shadow. 


### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Some BEM CSS class naming convention
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code:

```html

```
```css
.card-container {
    margin-top: 50px;
    animation: fadeIn 2s forwards;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-2em);
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);

    }
}


    .card-container {
        margin-left: 30px;
        margin-right: 30px;
        max-width: 1110px;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr);
        grid-template-areas: 
        ". two ."
        "one two four"
        "one three four"
        ". three .";
        gap: 30px;
    }

    .card--one {
    border-top: 4px solid var(--cyan);
    grid-area: one;
    }
    
    .image {
    width: 100%;
    padding-top: 32px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: end;
    }

    .card {
    background-color: var(--card);
    border-radius: 7px;
    padding: 23px 27px 27px;
    max-width: 310px;
    margin-top: 25px;
    box-shadow: 7px 7px 14px hsla(216, 92%, 75%, .2);
    }

```


### Continued development and resources

In the future, I want to be able to work faster and create nav bars with fluidly using flexbow. 

- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me with CSS Grid.
- [MDN Web Docs: Box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me with styling box shadows.
- [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with CSS Flexbox positioning. 
- [The 2020 Frontend Developer Crash Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA0XpGhiz5w&list=WL&index=1&t=7130s) - this helped get the idea of adding an animation. I think its a nice detail that adds professionalism.
